# BPP tutorial

This tutorial covers three functionality from the [BPP](https://github.com/bpp/bpp) software:

  * Estimation of the parameters of species divergence times and population sizes under the multi-species coalescent (MSC) model when the phylogeny is fixed.

  * Inference of the species tree under the MSC model.

  * Estimation of species divergence times, population sizes and introgression probabilities resp. migration rates under the MSC with introgression (MSC-I) model resp. MSC with migration (MSC-M) model.

The tutorial is available as a [Wiki page](https://github.com/xflouris/bpp-tutorial-mare/wiki).
